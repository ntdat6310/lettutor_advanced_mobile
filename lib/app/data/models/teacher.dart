I have been teaching grammar and literature for almost 10 years. I am fond of reading and teaching literature as one way of knowing oneâ€™s beliefs and culture. I am friendly and full of positivity. I love teaching because I know each student has something to bring on. Molding them to become an individual is a great success.";
